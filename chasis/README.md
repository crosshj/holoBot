More to follow on this.

From top to bottom:

- topCap - two ideas so far: handle and push button.  Mount for camera or asus xtion also being considered.

- dome

- walls 

- innerTube - channel routes wires from motor to main chasis compartment and keeps wires from rubbing magenetic encoder wheels

- innerBraceTower - hold the inner tube down

- motor mount - designed to fit Pololu gear motors.  At some point may switch to ABS depending on how PLA acts with the amount of heat that is created by motor operation.  Brace included to hold motor mounts in place.
