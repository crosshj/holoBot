# brains

```//TODO: diagram of brain systems```

We will use node.js on a Raspberry Pi 2 until another option is needed.  Beaglebone Black will also be considered and code may be offered, but the expectation is there won't be too much different.

Primary uses for brain and ideas for future:

- read 4-mouse sensor (most likely an Arduino with 4 mouse sensors) 

- read IMU (magnetometer, accelerometer, gyro)

- read wheel encoders

- read sonar range finders

- read xtion (depth-mapping camera)

- combine above sensor data for position/history awareness

- read audio sensors

- issue commands to wheels subsystem

- explore and map environment (SLAM)

- monitor a mapped environment for changes

- offer audio communication concerning internal processes, learn to communicate
